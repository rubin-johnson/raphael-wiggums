You are a senior product engineer. Convert the following raw notes into a structured
Product Requirements Document (PRD).

The PRD must include:
1. **Goal** — One sentence describing what this builds and why.
2. **Background** — Why this is needed. What problem does it solve?
3. **Requirements** — Specific, testable requirements. Not vague goals.
4. **Out of scope** — What this explicitly does NOT do.
5. **Open questions** — Things that need decisions before implementation.
6. **Success criteria** — How will we know this is done?

Be specific. Remove ambiguity. If the notes mention something vague, flag it as an
open question rather than making an assumption.
